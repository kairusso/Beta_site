		<p class="aboutP">Thousands of people search for housing in Boston every year, many of who are students. In determining the appropriate place they consider the cost of the rent, size of the unit, amenities included, and distance from point A to B. However a lot of students tend to overlook important things such as the safety of the neighborhood and how other elements may affect the comfort of their living.</p>
 
		<p class="aboutP">Over their summer internship, three fellows from the Department of Innovation and Technology came up with the idea of SPOTit. They were curious as to how different neighborhoods and specific properties evaluate when it comes to noise, cleanliness, crime, and other complaints filed by their neighbors. They developed an algorithm that visualizes public data and emphasizes specific information based on user preference.  The platform works hand in hand with other City of Boston initiatives to help preserve the integrity of the housing environment. It also allows users to make more informed decisions when searching for housing. Whether you are looking for a place that has been well maintained by the landlord or you want to view a breakdown of criminal activity around a specific neighborhood, go ahead and SPOTit.</p>
